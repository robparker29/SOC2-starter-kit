## 🆘 **Common Implementation Blockers**

### "We don't have time for this"
**Solution**: Focus on assessment-driven priorities. Address highest-impact, lowest-effort items first.
- Start with policies (no technical implementation required)
- Use automation to reduce manual effort
- Focus on areas with lowest assessment scores

### "Our team lacks compliance expertise"
**Solution**: Follow the structured checklist approach.
- Each item includes specific actions and commands
- Policies provide implementation guidance
- Assessment results show exactly what needs attention

### "We need multiple compliance frameworks"
**Solution**: Use the dual compliance strategy.
- Implement SOC 2 foundation first
- Generate mapping reports for NIST/ISO requirements
- Leverage overlapping controls for efficiency

### "We don't know if we're making progress"
**Solution**: Regular assessment retesting.
- Retake assessment monthly during implementation
- Track score improvements in each area
- Use automated compliance checks for ongoing monitoring
