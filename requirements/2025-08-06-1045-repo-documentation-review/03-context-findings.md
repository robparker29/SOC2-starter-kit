# Context Findings - Repository Documentation Review

## Current Documentation Structure Analysis

### Scattered Documentation Locations
**Files Analyzed:** 31 markdown files across multiple directories

**Key Documentation Files:**
- `README.md` (main) - Comprehensive but overwhelming for new users
- `Policies/README.md` - 332-line implementation guide
- `controls/readme.md` - Minimal placeholder content
- `soc2_automation/EVIDENCE_COLLECTION_GUIDE.md` - 305 lines of technical details
- `soc2_automation/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - 308 lines of security fixes
- `soc2_automation/MULTICLOUD_README.md` - 465 lines of advanced technical content
- `soc2_automation/README_inactive_users.md` - 313 lines of script-specific documentation

### User Journey Pain Points

#### 1. No Clear Starting Path
- Main README.md immediately dives into technical commands
- No progressive disclosure based on user needs
- Three different "getting started" sections across different files

#### 2. Information Overload
- Main README.md: 337 lines covering everything from installation to advanced usage
- Technical implementation details mixed with high-level concepts
- Multiple comprehensive guides competing for attention

#### 3. Audience Confusion
- Policy documentation (business/compliance audience) mixed with technical automation
- No clear segmentation between different user types:
  - Compliance professionals needing policies
  - Developers implementing automation
  - Auditors reviewing controls

#### 4. Redundant Information
- Installation instructions repeated across multiple files
- SOC 2 control mappings duplicated in various locations
- Configuration examples scattered throughout documentation

### Current Documentation Strengths
- Comprehensive coverage of all features
- Detailed technical implementation guides
- Clear command examples and usage patterns
- Well-structured policy templates
- Good integration examples

### Missing Quick Reference Materials
- No cheat sheets for common tasks
- No decision trees for choosing components
- No troubleshooting quick reference
- No glossary of SOC 2 terms

## Specific Files Requiring Attention

### README.md Issues:
- Combines overview, installation, configuration, usage, and advanced topics
- 71 lines before any actionable content
- Technical commands presented without context for newcomers

### Policy Documentation Issues:
- `Policies/README.md` is comprehensive but not discoverable from main README
- Implementation guide buried within policy directory
- No clear relationship to automation tools

### Technical Documentation Issues:
- Four separate README files in `soc2_automation/` directory
- Each focuses on different aspects without cross-references
- Advanced multi-cloud content presented at same level as basic usage
