# Requirements Specification - Repository Documentation Restructure

## Problem Statement

The SOC 2 starter kit repository has become cluttered with 31+ markdown files scattered across multiple directories, making it difficult for new users to understand where to start and what they need. The documentation lacks clear user journeys and mixes different audience needs (compliance professionals vs. developers) in the same documents.

## Solution Overview

Restructure the documentation to provide a clean, uncluttered experience with clear pathways for different user needs while maintaining comprehensive coverage for advanced users.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Streamlined Main README.md
- **Brief purpose statement** (2-3 sentences maximum)
- **Immediate actionable quick start** (5 minutes to first success)
- **Clear signposting** to advanced features without cluttering main flow
- **Remove** the current 71-line introduction section

### 2. Clean Repository Structure
- **Move technical documentation** from `soc2_automation/*.md` to new `docs/technical/` directory
- **Consolidate** scattered technical guides into organized sections
- **Maintain** policy documentation in `Policies/` directory
- **Create** clear visual separation between user types

### 3. Progressive Disclosure Architecture
- **Basic usage first** - single cloud, essential features
- **Advanced features clearly marked** but discoverable
- **Multi-cloud documentation** moved to advanced section with clear navigation
- **Complex configurations** separated from basic setup

### 4. Quick Reference Materials
- **Single-page quick start guide** replacing verbose introductions
- **Command cheat sheets** for common operations
- **Troubleshooting quick reference** 
- **Decision tree** for choosing components

## Technical Requirements

└── soc2_automation/ (code only, no documentation)
```

### Content Requirements

#### New README.md Structure (target: <100 lines)
1. **Purpose** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Quick Start** (link to QUICK_START.md)
3. **What's Included** (3-4 key components)
4. **Choose Your Path** 
   - Basic Setup → QUICK_START.md
   - Policies Only → Policies/README.md
   - Advanced Features → docs/advanced/
5. **Support/Contributing** (minimal)

#### New QUICK_START.md Content
1. **Prerequisites** (1-2 requirements)
2. **Install** (1-2 commands)
3. **First Run** (single command to demonstrate value)
4. **Next Steps** (links to relevant sections)

#### Advanced Documentation Organization
- **Clear headers** indicating complexity level
- **Prerequisites** clearly stated for each advanced topic
- **Cross-references** between related advanced topics
- **Navigation back** to basic documentation

## Implementation Hints and Patterns

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Current `soc2-audit` CLI structure is excellent - maintain this as the entry point
- Existing policy template organization works well
- JSON configuration examples are clear and well-structured

### Content Migration Strategy
1. **Preserve** all existing technical content (move, don't rewrite)
2. **Extract** quick start elements from existing comprehensive guides
3. **Add navigation** between basic and advanced content
4. **Maintain** existing command examples and technical accuracy

### File Path Updates Required
- Update internal links in moved documentation files
- Update any references in code comments to documentation paths
- Ensure relative links work in new directory structure

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Experience Criteria
- [ ] New user can complete first successful task within 5 minutes of repository discovery
- [ ] Repository root directory contains <10 markdown files
- [ ] Advanced users can find multi-cloud and complex features within 2 clicks
- [ ] Technical documentation is cleanly separated from policy content

### Content Quality Criteria
- [ ] All existing technical content is preserved and accessible
- [ ] No broken internal links after restructure
- [ ] Each documentation section has clear audience and purpose
- [ ] Quick reference materials are actionable without external context

### Structure Criteria
- [ ] `docs/technical/` directory contains all automation documentation
- [ ] Main README.md is <100 lines
- [ ] QUICK_START.md gets users to first success in <10 steps
- [ ] Advanced features are discoverable but not overwhelming

## Assumptions

### Content Assumptions
- **Existing technical accuracy** will be maintained during restructure
- **Current CLI interface** (`soc2-audit`) remains the primary user interface
- **Policy templates** in `Policies/` directory are already well-organized

### User Assumptions
- **New users** prefer guided quick start over comprehensive documentation
- **Advanced users** can navigate to complex topics when needed
- **Different user types** (compliance vs. technical) have distinct needs

### Technical Assumptions
- **Repository structure** changes won't affect functionality of automation scripts
- **Internal documentation links** can be updated without breaking external references
- **Current installation process** is fundamentally sound and just needs better presentation

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- **Time to first success** for new users (target: <5 minutes)
- **Repository bounce rate** (users who view README but take no action)
- **Advanced feature discovery** (users who find multi-cloud documentation)

### Maintenance Metrics
- **Documentation maintenance overhead** (should decrease with better organization)
- **User support questions** about "where to find X" (should decrease)
- **Contributor onboarding time** (should improve with cleaner structure)

This specification provides a clear roadmap for creating a clean, user-friendly documentation structure while preserving all existing functionality and comprehensive coverage for advanced users.
