# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-08-06 10:45
**Request:** The repo is intended to be a user friendly space. I'm worried it has become cluttered and the instructions are distributed across too many markdown files. Review and give me your feedback on the clarity and ease of use for someone not familiar with the repo. Should we create a centralized readme that describes the use of each item in a step-by-step formulaic walkthrough?

**Context:** User is concerned about repository documentation being scattered across multiple markdown files, making it difficult for new users to navigate and understand how to use the SOC 2 starter kit effectively.
