# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-08-06 11:00
**Request:** I want to make a similar script as the soc2 nist control mapping, but with soc2 controls mapped to ISO controls

**Context:** User wants to create a comprehensive SOC 2 to ISO 27001:2022 control mapping script similar to the existing SOC 2 to NIST SP 800-53 mapping that was just successfully implemented. This will provide organizations with dual compliance capabilities for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 frameworks.
