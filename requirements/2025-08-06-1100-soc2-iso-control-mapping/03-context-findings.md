## SOC 2 to ISO Mapping Opportunities

### Direct Mapping Candidates
- **CC6.1-CC6.3** (Access Controls) → **A.8.1-A.8.4** (User Access Management)
- **CC7.1-CC7.2** (System Monitoring) → **A.8.15-A.8.16** (Logging and Monitoring)
- **CC8.1** (Change Management) → **A.8.32** (Change Management)
- **CC3.1-CC3.4** (Risk Assessment) → **Clause 6** (Planning - Risk Assessment)
- **CC1.1-CC1.5** (Control Environment) → **Clause 5** (Leadership) + **A.5.1** (Information Security Policies)

### Partial Mapping Opportunities
- **A1.1-A1.3** (Availability) → **A.8.13** (Information Backup) + **A.7.4** (Equipment Maintenance)
- **PI1.1-PI1.3** (Processing Integrity) → **A.8.7** (Malware Protection) + **A.8.28** (Secure Coding)
- **C1.1-C1.2** (Confidentiality) → **A.8.24** (Use of Cryptography) + **A.5.10-A.5.12** (Information Classification)
- **P1.1-P8.1** (Privacy) → **A.5.34** (Privacy and Protection of PII)

### Industry-Specific Considerations
