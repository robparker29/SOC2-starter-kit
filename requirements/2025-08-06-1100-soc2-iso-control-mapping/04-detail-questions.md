# Detail Questions - SOC 2 to ISO 27001 Control Mapping

## Q1: Should the script prioritize Annex A controls over management system clauses for SOC 2 mappings?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (Annex A controls are more directly comparable to SOC 2 security controls)

## Q2: Should we include ISO 27001:2022's 4-theme structure (Organizational, People, Physical, Technology) in the mapping organization?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (aligns with ISO 27001:2022's modernized control categorization)

## Q3: Should the mapping distinguish between "must implement" controls vs. "based on risk assessment" controls per ISO 27001 Annex A?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (ISO 27001 requires risk-based control selection, unlike SOC 2's universal applicability)

## Q4: Should we create separate mappings for ISO 27002:2022 implementation guidance attributes (purpose, implementation, other information)?
**Default if unknown:** No (focus on control mappings; implementation guidance can be referenced but not separately mapped)

## Q5: Should the Excel output include a "Certification Readiness" assessment based on mapping coverage?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (helps organizations understand ISO 27001 certification gaps when implementing SOC 2)
