# Requirements Specification - SOC 2 to ISO 27001:2022 Control Mapping Script

## Problem Statement

Organizations implementing SOC 2 compliance often need to achieve ISO 27001 certification as well, especially for international business or customer requirements. Currently, there is no comprehensive mapping between SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria and ISO 27001:2022 controls, forcing organizations to duplicate effort and maintain separate compliance programs.

## Solution Overview

Create a comprehensive SOC 2 to ISO 27001:2022 control mapping script that generates a detailed Excel analysis similar to the existing NIST mapping, enabling dual compliance strategies and efficient resource allocation.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive Control Mapping
- **SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria** mapped to **ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls** (93 controls)
- **SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria** mapped to **ISO 27001:2022 Management System clauses** (4-10)  
- **Bidirectional mapping** (ISO to SOC 2 and SOC 2 to ISO)
- **ISO 27002:2022 implementation guidance** references for each control

### 2. ISO 27001:2022 Structure Alignment
- **4-theme organization**: A.5 Organizational, A.6 People, A.7 Physical, A.8 Technology
- **Risk-based control selection** indicators (mandatory vs. risk assessment-based)
- **ISO control categories** and implementation complexity levels
- **Management system integration** points

### 3. Mapping Quality Indicators
- **Relationship strength**: Direct, Partial, Indirect, Complementary
- **Implementation overlap**: High, Medium, Low coverage
- **Evidence sharing opportunities** between frameworks
- **Gap analysis** for controls unique to each framework

### 4. Industry Customization
- **SaaS/Cloud**: Multi-tenancy, API security, cloud-native controls
- **Financial**: Payment security, fraud prevention, regulatory compliance
- **Healthcare**: PHI protection, medical device security, HIPAA-ISO alignment
- **Manufacturing**: OT security, supply chain, industrial control systems
- **Government**: Public sector requirements, classified information handling

### 5. Certification Readiness Assessment
- **Coverage analysis**: Which ISO controls are addressed by SOC 2
- **Gap identification**: ISO-specific requirements not covered by SOC 2
- **Implementation roadmap**: Phased approach to dual compliance
- **Effort estimation**: Resource requirements for gaps

## Implementation Hints and Patterns

### Reuse from NIST Mapping
- **Color coding system** for mapping types and priorities
- **Multi-sheet Excel generation** with formatting functions  
- **Industry-specific customization** approach
- **Executive dashboard** creation patterns
- **Summary statistics** calculation methods

### ISO-Specific Enhancements
- **4-theme control organization** (vs. NIST family structure)
- **Risk-based selection** indicators (unique to ISO 27001)
- **Management system integration** points (clauses 4-10)
- **Certification readiness** assessment (vs. NIST compliance focus)

### Mapping Data Sources
- **ISO 27001:2022** Annex A controls (93 controls)
- **ISO 27002:2022** implementation guidance
- **SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria** (2017 version)
- **Industry best practices** for dual compliance

## Acceptance Criteria

### Content Quality
- [ ] All 93 ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls mapped to relevant SOC 2 criteria
- [ ] Management system clauses (4-10) mapped where applicable
- [ ] Industry-specific guidance provided for 5 key sectors
- [ ] Certification readiness assessment identifies gaps and coverage

### Technical Quality  
- [ ] Excel file generated with same formatting quality as NIST mapping
- [ ] Color coding and visual indicators work correctly
- [ ] Multiple sheets with consistent navigation
- [ ] Summary statistics and dashboard provide actionable insights

### Usability Quality
- [ ] Organizations can identify shared evidence opportunities
