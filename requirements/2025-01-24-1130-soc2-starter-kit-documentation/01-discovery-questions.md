# Discovery Questions - SOC 2 Starter Kit Documentation

## Q1: Should the SOC 2 readiness assessment HTML tool be the primary entry point for new users?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (assessment-first approach aligns with stated objective of helping startups "assess their readiness")

## Q2: Should the user journey flow from assessment → gap identification → targeted remediation tools?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (this creates a logical progression from diagnosis to solution)

## Q3: Should the control mapping tools (NIST/ISO) be prominently featured for organizations pursuing dual compliance?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (many organizations need multiple compliance frameworks)

## Q4: Should the README emphasize the complete solution (assess + remediate) rather than just the automation tools?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (better represents the full value proposition for startups)

## Q5: Should we create a clear "startup journey" path that differs from the current technical implementation focus?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (startups need guidance on where to begin, not just how to run commands)
