# Detail Questions - SOC 2 Starter Kit Documentation

## Q1: Should the README start with "Take Your Free SOC 2 Readiness Assessment" as the primary call-to-action?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (makes the assessment the hero feature and removes friction for first-time users)

## Q2: Should we create assessment-result-specific quick start paths (e.g., "Your assessment shows gaps in Access Control - start here")?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides personalized guidance based on actual assessment results rather than generic instructions)

## Q3: Should the control mapping tools be positioned as "Dual Compliance Strategy" for organizations needing SOC 2 + NIST/ISO?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (clearly communicates the business value and differentiates from basic SOC 2 tools)

## Q4: Should we restructure QUICK_START.md to begin with the assessment rather than CLI installation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (aligns with assessment-first user journey and reduces intimidation factor for non-technical users)

## Q5: Should we add a "Startup Readiness Checklist" that maps assessment results to specific next actions?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides clear, actionable guidance that startups can follow step-by-step)
