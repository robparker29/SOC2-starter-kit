# Context Findings - AWS Inactive Users Script

## Existing Codebase Analysis

### Key Files to Reference/Extend:
1. **`soc2_automation/lib/soc2_models.py`** - Contains `UserAccessRecord` and `AccessReviewFinding` data models
2. **`soc2_automation/lib/soc2_utils.py`** - Shared utilities for AWS clients, logging, CSV reports
3. **`soc2_automation/lib/soc2_collectors.py`** - Has existing AWS user collection methods
4. **`scripts/User Access Reviews/user_access_review.py`** - Similar functionality for reference

### Technical Integration Points:

#### Data Models Available:
- **`UserAccessRecord`**: Standard user record with fields for username, email, system, last_login, permissions, etc.
- **`AccessReviewFinding`**: Standard finding format with severity, SOC 2 control mapping, remediation actions

#### Utility Functions Available:
- **`SOC2Utils.initialize_aws_client()`**: Standardized AWS client initialization
- **`SOC2Utils.setup_logging()`**: Consistent logging configuration
- **`SOC2Utils.write_csv_report()`**: Audit-ready CSV report generation
- **`SOC2Utils.create_output_directory()`**: Timestamped output directory creation

#### Existing AWS Collection Methods:
- **`collect_aws_users()`**: Already collects AWS users with permissions and activity
- **`_get_aws_user_last_activity()`**: Gets access key last-used dates
- **`_get_aws_user_permissions()`**: Collects user permissions and groups
- **`_get_aws_user_mfa_status()`**: Checks MFA enablement

### Multi-Account Support Requirements:
Based on user requirement for multi-account analysis, we need:
- Configuration structure for multiple AWS accounts
- Cross-account IAM role assumption capabilities
- Account-specific credential management
- Consolidated reporting across accounts

### Ticket Creation Integration:
- Existing Jira ticket creation pattern in `user_access_review.py`
- Configurable ticket creation with enable/disable option
- Template-based ticket descriptions with SOC 2 control mapping

### Similar Features Found:
1. **User Access Review script** - Very similar functionality, can reuse patterns
2. **Config Drift Detection** - Similar reporting and finding structures
3. **Evidence Collection** - Similar output directory and file management patterns

### Implementation Patterns to Follow:
- Class-based architecture with config initialization
- Separate methods for collection, analysis, and reporting
- Standardized error handling and logging
- CLI argument parsing for configuration options
- Output to timestamped directories with multiple formats

### SOC 2 Control Mappings:
- **CC6.1**: Logical Access Controls (inactive user detection)
- **CC6.2**: Least Privilege (unused access key identification)
- **CC6.3**: Access Review and Approval (periodic access validation)
