## 1. Purpose & Scope

This policy establishes requirements for managing user access to information systems, applications, and data. It ensures that access is granted based on business need, properly authorized, and regularly reviewed.

**Why this matters:** Access controls are fundamental to SOC 2 compliance. Auditors will scrutinize how you grant, monitor, and revoke access to verify the principle of least privilege.

### 1.1 Scope
This policy applies to:
- All information systems, applications, and databases
- Physical access to facilities and equipment
- Remote access and mobile device connectivity
- Third-party and vendor access arrangements
- All users including employees, contractors, and external parties

### 1.2 Objectives
- Ensure access is granted only to authorized individuals
- Implement least privilege principles
- Maintain accurate records of user access rights
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems

---

## 2. Access Control Principles

### 2.1 Least Privilege
Users are granted the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions. Access rights are based on:
- Job role and responsibilities
- Business justification and approval
- Data classification and sensitivity levels
- Segregation of duties requirements

### 2.2 Need-to-Know Basis
Access to information is restricted to individuals who require it for legitimate business purposes.

### 2.3 Segregation of Duties
Critical functions are divided among multiple individuals to prevent fraud and errors. No single individual should have complete control over critical business processes.

## 13. Implementation Guidance

### 13.1 Getting Started Checklist
- [ ] Identify all systems requiring access controls
- [ ] Define user roles and corresponding access rights
- [ ] Establish approval workflows for access requests
- [ ] Implement MFA for privileged accounts
- [ ] Set up access review schedules and responsibilities
- [ ] Create access control procedures and documentation
- [ ] Train staff on access control requirements

### 13.2 Quick Start for Small Organizations
Essential access controls to implement first:
1. Standard user roles with defined permissions
2. Manager approval for all access requests
3. MFA for administrative accounts
4. Monthly review of privileged access
5. Immediate access removal upon termination

### 13.3 Scaling Considerations
As your organization grows:
- **10-25 employees:** Basic role definitions, manual access reviews
- **25-100 employees:** Standardized provisioning, quarterly reviews, IAM tools
- **100+ employees:** Automated provisioning, advanced RBAC, continuous monitoring
