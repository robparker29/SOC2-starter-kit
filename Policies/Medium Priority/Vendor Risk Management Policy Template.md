## 1. Purpose & Scope

This policy establishes the framework for identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with third-party vendors and service providers that have access to [COMPANY NAME]'s systems, data, or business operations. It ensures that vendor relationships maintain appropriate security and compliance standards.

- Cloud service providers and software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors
- Professional services firms and consultants
- Vendors with access to company systems, data, or facilities
- Subcontractors and fourth-party relationships

### 1.2 Objectives
- Ensure vendors meet appropriate security and compliance standards
- Minimize risks from third-party relationships
- Maintain visibility and control over vendor access and activities
- Support business objectives while managing vendor-related risks
- Ensure compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements
